# Network Tab

_Compare the time DOMContentLoaded and Finish time for your usual internet connection and Slow 3G_  

<br>

Under the usual internet connection, the DOMContentLoaded event, which indicates when the HTML is fully parsed, occurs at 1.05 seconds. In contrast, when simulating a slow 3G connection, this event takes significantly longer, happening at 9.41 seconds, showing a substantial increase in loading time due to reduced network speed.
