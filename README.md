This repository contains my homework assignments as part of an internship program focused on gaining proficiency in popular API testing tools including Postman, Charles, and Chrome DevTools. It offers practical exercises and resources to effectively use these tools for building and testing APIs, thereby enhancing my software development skills.
- **Postman:** Tasks to help learn API creation, testing, and deployment.
- **Charles:** Exercises to understand and use this web proxy for HTTP monitoring and debugging.
- **Chrome DevTools:** Assignments to explore and utilize these tools for web application troubleshooting and optimization.  

The repository also encompasses basic **SQL** tasks and introductory **GitHub** exercises as part of the comprehensive training in software development practices provided by the internship.
